# School Schedule Optimization with Pyomo and Highs #

This project is aimed at developing an optimization algorithm for creating a school schedule that meets certain constraints and criteria. The algorithm will be developed using Pyomo and Highs, which are powerful optimization libraries in Python.

The project will include two different types of algorithm:

An open-source algorithm with basic functionality that can be used by anyone.
A self-private algorithm, where data-preparation, client-server communication and the web interface will be open-source, but the algorithm itself will be private.
In addition, a website will be created where users can import their own settings for the schedule and run the optimization algorithm. The website will be developed using Python, Flask, and other web development libraries and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project will be developed using the following libraries and techniques:

- Pyomo
- Highs
- Flask
- Pandas
- requests
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for front-end web development)


The project is open-source, and contributions are welcome. However, please note that the private algorithm will not be available for public use.
